## Mission to Mars: A Web-Scraping Activity

### Overview
Robin is developing a web app to showcase the latest news, facts, and images related to Mars. She dreams of one day working for NASA and hopes that this web app will be a tool that showcases her passion for space and her abilities in web design and analytics. The goal of this project is to use a variety of web-scraping tools to automate visits to various websites with Mars related content and for Robin to grab that data to store on a Mongo database. She'll use a web application to then, display the latest and greatest compiled Mars news online.

#### Deliverable 1:
We'll scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the image titles using BeautifulSoup and Splinter. We start by scraping the images and then, printing the URLs to a list of dictionary items.

#### Deliverable 2:
We start by converting our Jupyter notebook to a Python file. Then, we run our app.py file to activate automated scraping using a Mongo database to retrieve and store the scraped data. Flask is used to display the application on the web. An HTML file was written to display the scraped data.

#### Deliverable 3:
For this deliverable, we updated the html file to make sure our web app is both mobile-responsive and to customize the site. The Bootstrap 3 components include modifying the background color as well as creating thumbnails to display the Hemisphere images.
